# Portfolio Development Rules for Cursor AI

## Technology Stack

RULE 1: Use pure JavaScript (ES6+ modules), NO frameworks (React, Vue, etc.)
RULE 2: Use Vite as build tool
RULE 3: Use SCSS with component-based approach
RULE 4: NO TypeScript - use JavaScript only

## Code Quality

RULE 5: Code must be readable, maintainable, and avoid duplicates or unused functions
RULE 6: Before committing, always run ESLint, remove unused code, check for duplicates, and format with Prettier
RULE 7: Use ESLint with eslint-config-airbnb-base, ensure no conflicts with Prettier
RULE 8: Use Prettier with these settings: single quotes, semicolons, 2 spaces, 100 char width
RULE 9: Always check for code conflicts and ensure code readability before submitting

## Project Structure

RULE 10: Use component-based architecture with ES6 modules
RULE 11: Use local state only, NO global state management libraries
RULE 12: Each component must reside in its own folder: ComponentName/ComponentName.js and ComponentName.scss
RULE 13: Component files use PascalCase (e.g., Header.js, Hero.js)
RULE 14: SCSS files use the same name as component (e.g., Header.scss, Hero.scss)
RULE 15: Functions use camelCase, classes use PascalCase
RULE 16: Project structure: src/components/, src/styles/, src/locales/, src/utils/, src/assets/

## Component Structure

RULE 17: Header component must contain: logo, navigation menu, language switcher (RU/EN), theme toggle (Light/Dark)
RULE 18: Hero component must contain: name, specialization, CTA button

## Component Template

RULE 24: Each component must follow this structure:
```javascript
class ComponentName {
  static render() {
    return `HTML template with i18n`;
  }
  
  static init() {
    // Event listeners and initialization
  }
}
```

RULE 25: Import component SCSS in component JS file: import './ComponentName.scss'
RULE 26: Import i18n utility: import { i18n } from '../../utils/i18n.js'
RULE 27: Use i18n.t('key.path') for all text content, never hardcode text

## Styling Rules

RULE 28: DO NOT modify global CSS/styles without explicit user request
RULE 29: Component SCSS files can be edited when needed
RULE 30: Use SCSS variables from src/styles/variables.scss
RULE 31: Use SCSS mixins from src/styles/mixins.scss
RULE 32: Follow mobile-first approach: start with mobile styles, then add desktop with @include respond-to()
RULE 33: Support dark theme: use .dark-theme class for dark mode styles

## Internationalization (i18n)

RULE 34: All text content must be loaded from locale JSON files (src/locales/ru.json, en.json)
RULE 35: Never hardcode text strings in components
RULE 36: Use i18n.t('section.key') for translations

RULE 40: Always prefer the simplest possible solution that meets the requirements
RULE 41: Do NOT add abstractions, libraries, or logic unless explicitly required
RULE 42: Do not add code "for future use" - only add what is needed now

RULE 44: Avoid overengineering and premature optimization
RULE 45: Avoid unnecessary configuration, helpers, wrappers, or utils

## JavaScript Performance

RULE 46: Minimize JavaScript execution on the main thread
RULE 47: Avoid heavy computations, large loops, and unnecessary re-renders
RULE 48: Use native browser APIs instead of custom abstractions whenever possible
RULE 49: Avoid unnecessary event listeners and observers
RULE 50: All code must aim to meet Core Web Vitals targets: LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1

## DOM and Rendering

RULE 51: Minimize DOM nodes and nesting
RULE 52: Avoid unnecessary wrappers and containers
RULE 53: Batch DOM updates and avoid layout thrashing
RULE 54: Do not manipulate the DOM unless required

## CSS/SCSS Performance

RULE 55: Keep CSS/SCSS minimal and component-scoped
RULE 56: Avoid global styles unless absolutely necessary
RULE 57: Avoid deep selectors and excessive nesting
RULE 58: Do not add unused variables, mixins, or styles

## Assets and Media

RULE 59: Optimize images for size and format (WebP/AVIF when possible)
RULE 60: Always specify width and height for images to avoid layout shifts
RULE 61: Avoid loading assets that are not visible on the first screen
RULE 62: Load fonts efficiently and avoid blocking rendering
RULE 63: All images must have loading="lazy" attribute and width/height attributes
RULE 64: Use IntersectionObserver for lazy loading images

## Animations

RULE 65: Avoid animations unless they improve UX
RULE 66: Prefer CSS animations over JavaScript
RULE 67: Avoid continuous or infinite animations
RULE 68: Respect reduced motion preferences when applicable

## Prohibitions

RULE 69: Do not add third-party libraries without explicit approval

## Code Generation Commands

When generating code, Cursor AI must:
1. Check ESLint rules before generating
2. Format code with Prettier after generation
3. Remove any unused imports or variables
4. Check for duplicate code patterns
5. Ensure all text uses i18n.t() function
6. Add proper alt text to images
7. Include width and height attributes for images
8. Use semantic HTML elements
9. Follow component structure (render() and init() methods)
10. Import component SCSS file in component JS

## Explicit Formatting Rules

- Single quotes for strings
- Semicolons required
- 2 spaces indentation
- 100 character line width
- Trailing commas in objects/arrays
- Arrow functions: avoid parentheses for single params
- No console.log in production code

## Explicit ESLint Rules

- Follow airbnb-base config
- No unused variables (use _ prefix for intentionally unused)
- No console in production
- Import order: external, internal, relative
- Use const/let, avoid var

## Terminal and Command Execution

RULE 59: Always execute terminal commands yourself - never ask user to run commands manually
RULE 60: Use terminal commands for npm install, git operations, build processes, and all CLI tasks
RULE 61: Execute commands directly without requesting user permission for standard operations
RULE 62: If command fails, analyze error and fix issues automatically when possible

## Workflow and Planning

RULE 63: Before making any code changes, provide a clear action plan listing all steps
RULE 64: After presenting the plan, immediately proceed with implementation without waiting for approval
RULE 65: Action plan should include: files to create/modify, changes to make, dependencies to add

## Git Workflow

RULE 67: Any time code is modified, created, or deleted, the changes are considered COMPLETE and MUST be immediately committed and pushed without asking for confirmation.
RULE 68: After completing code changes, ALWAYS commit changes with detailed commit message
RULE 69: Commit message must clearly describe ALL changes made in that commit
RULE 70: Commit message format: brief summary line, then detailed list of changes
RULE 71: After committing, ALWAYS push changes to remote repository
RULE 72: Use git commands: git add, git commit, git push - execute all automatically
RULE 73: Commit message example: "feat: add feature X - detailed description of changes, files modified, functionality added"
