# Portfolio Development Rules for Cursor AI

## Technology Stack

RULE 1: Use pure JavaScript (ES6+ modules), NO frameworks (React, Vue, etc.)
RULE 2: Use Vite as build tool
RULE 3: Use SCSS with component-based approach
RULE 4: NO TypeScript - use JavaScript only

## Code Quality

RULE 5: Code must be readable, maintainable, and avoid duplicates or unused functions
RULE 6: Before committing, always run ESLint, remove unused code, check for duplicates, and format with Prettier
RULE 7: Use ESLint with eslint-config-airbnb-base, ensure no conflicts with Prettier
RULE 8: Use Prettier with these settings: single quotes, semicolons, 2 spaces, 100 char width
RULE 9: Always check for code conflicts and ensure code readability before submitting

## Project Structure

RULE 10: Use component-based architecture with ES6 modules
RULE 11: Use local state only, NO global state management libraries
RULE 12: Each component must reside in its own folder: ComponentName/ComponentName.js and ComponentName.scss
RULE 13: Component files use PascalCase (e.g., Header.js, Hero.js)
RULE 14: SCSS files use the same name as component (e.g., Header.scss, Hero.scss)
RULE 15: Functions use camelCase, classes use PascalCase
RULE 16: Project structure: src/components/, src/styles/, src/locales/, src/utils/, src/assets/

## Component Structure

RULE 17: Header component must contain: logo, navigation menu, language switcher (RU/EN), theme toggle (Light/Dark)
RULE 18: Hero component must contain: name, specialization, CTA button
RULE 19: About component must contain: photo/image, description text, skills list
RULE 20: Projects component must contain: grid of project cards, filter by categories (UI, Web, Branding)
RULE 21: Project Detail component must contain: image gallery, description, links (demo, code)
RULE 22: Testimonials component must contain: slider/carousel with client testimonials
RULE 23: Contact component must contain: contact form (name, email, message), social media links

## Component Template

RULE 24: Each component must follow this structure:
```javascript
class ComponentName {
  static render() {
    return `HTML template with i18n`;
  }
  
  static init() {
    // Event listeners and initialization
  }
}
```

RULE 25: Import component SCSS in component JS file: import './ComponentName.scss'
RULE 26: Import i18n utility: import { i18n } from '../../utils/i18n.js'
RULE 27: Use i18n.t('key.path') for all text content, never hardcode text

## Styling Rules

RULE 28: DO NOT modify global CSS/styles without explicit user request
RULE 29: Component SCSS files can be edited when needed
RULE 30: Use SCSS variables from src/styles/variables.scss
RULE 31: Use SCSS mixins from src/styles/mixins.scss
RULE 32: Follow mobile-first approach: start with mobile styles, then add desktop with @include respond-to()
RULE 33: Support dark theme: use .dark-theme class for dark mode styles

## Internationalization (i18n)

RULE 34: All text content must be loaded from locale JSON files (src/locales/ru.json, en.json)
RULE 35: Never hardcode text strings in components
RULE 36: Use i18n.t('section.key') for translations
RULE 37: Support Russian (ru) and English (en) languages
RULE 38: Language switcher must update all text content via i18n

## Performance Optimization

RULE 39: Optimize for LCP < 2.5s: use lazy-loading for images, optimize images, optimize fonts
RULE 40: Optimize for FID < 100ms: use code-splitting, async/defer scripts, minimize JS on main thread
RULE 41: Optimize for CLS < 0.1: specify element dimensions, use placeholder blocks for images, stable fonts
RULE 42: All images must have loading="lazy" attribute and width/height attributes
RULE 43: Use IntersectionObserver for lazy loading images

## SEO

RULE 44: Use semantic HTML elements (header, nav, main, section, article, footer)
RULE 45: Include meta tags: title, description, og:tags, twitter:tags
RULE 46: Add structured data (JSON-LD) for SEO
RULE 47: All images must have descriptive alt text
RULE 48: Use proper heading hierarchy (h1-h6)
RULE 49: Include robots.txt and sitemap.xml

## Testing

RULE 50: Critical components and utility functions must include unit tests
RULE 51: Tests should be in __tests__ folder next to the file being tested
RULE 52: Use Vitest for testing
RULE 53: Test file naming: ComponentName.test.js or functionName.test.js

## File Management

RULE 54: Delete outdated files, directories, and archives - keep only current relevant files
RULE 55: Maintain clean project structure with only necessary files

## Deployment

RULE 56: Hosting: Beget
RULE 57: Domain: https://develonik.ru/
RULE 58: Production build must be optimized: minification, compression, code splitting

## Code Generation Commands

When generating code, Cursor AI must:
1. Check ESLint rules before generating
2. Format code with Prettier after generation
3. Remove any unused imports or variables
4. Check for duplicate code patterns
5. Ensure all text uses i18n.t() function
6. Add proper alt text to images
7. Include width and height attributes for images
8. Use semantic HTML elements
9. Follow component structure (render() and init() methods)
10. Import component SCSS file in component JS

## Explicit Formatting Rules

- Single quotes for strings
- Semicolons required
- 2 spaces indentation
- 100 character line width
- Trailing commas in objects/arrays
- Arrow functions: avoid parentheses for single params
- No console.log in production code

## Explicit ESLint Rules

- Follow airbnb-base config
- No unused variables (use _ prefix for intentionally unused)
- No console in production
- Import order: external, internal, relative
- Use const/let, avoid var

## Terminal and Command Execution

RULE 59: Always execute terminal commands yourself - never ask user to run commands manually
RULE 60: Use terminal commands for npm install, git operations, build processes, and all CLI tasks
RULE 61: Execute commands directly without requesting user permission for standard operations
RULE 62: If command fails, analyze error and fix issues automatically when possible

## Workflow and Planning

RULE 63: Before making any code changes, provide a clear action plan listing all steps
RULE 64: After presenting the plan, immediately proceed with implementation without waiting for approval
RULE 65: Action plan should include: files to create/modify, changes to make, dependencies to add
RULE 66: Execute all planned changes in sequence, completing the full task

## Git Workflow

RULE 67: After completing code changes, ALWAYS commit changes with detailed commit message
RULE 68: Commit message must clearly describe ALL changes made in that commit
RULE 69: Commit message format: brief summary line, then detailed list of changes
RULE 70: After committing, ALWAYS push changes to remote repository
RULE 71: Use git commands: git add, git commit, git push - execute all automatically
RULE 72: Commit message example: "feat: add feature X - detailed description of changes, files modified, functionality added"
